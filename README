NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::RDBO - Authentication and
    authorization against a Rose::DB::Object model.

VERSION
    This document describes Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::RDBO
    version 0.002.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst;

        __PACKAGE__->setup(
            qw(
               Authentication
               Authentication::Store::DBIC
               Authentication::Credential::Password
               Authorization::Roles
              )
        );

        # Authentication
        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{rdbo} = {
            user_class         => 'User',     # or 'MyApp::Model::User'
            user_field         => 'username',
            password_field     => 'password',
            password_type      => 'hashed',   # or 'clear'
            password_hash_type => 'SHA-1',
        };

        # Authorization
        __PACKAGE__->config->{authorization}{rdbo} = {
            role_rel   => 'roles',  # name of the many-to-many relationship
            role_field => 'name',
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin uses a Rose::DB::Object object to authenticate an user. It
    is based on Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC. Please read
    there for a much better description.

DIFFERENCES
    Currently only a single field for the "user_field" parameter is
    supported. The DBIC plugin supports also an array reference. This can be
    added in a future version.

    The default for "user_field" is "username" instead of "user".

    The configuration for authorization is much simpler, only two parameters
    are needed. "role_rel" specifies the name of the many-to-many
    relationship which connects user and role names. "role_field" is the
    column accessor for the role name. (For
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles roles are just strings.)
